### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This Python project allows users to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script takes user input to filter the data and provides interactive statistics related to the most popular times of travel, the most popular stations, trip duration, and user information like gender and birth year.

### Files Used
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script that runs the bikeshare analysis.
- `chicago.csv`: The data file for Chicago. (Note: this file is ignored in uploads to GitHub due to its size.)
- `new_york_city.csv`: The data file for New York City. (Note: this file is ignored in uploads to GitHub due to its size.)
- `washington.csv`: The data file for Washington. (Note: this file is ignored in uploads to GitHub due to its size.)
